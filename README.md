# Task Description
Write a function

function solution(A);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:

     A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
     A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
     
the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
    each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].

# Both Algoritm with same efficiency
     
     * JavaScript built-in sort (main.js)
     * Hands-on Quick sort (hands-on.sort.js)
